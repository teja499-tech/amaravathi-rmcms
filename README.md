## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/teja499-tech/amaravathi-rmcms.git
   cd amaravathi-rmcms
   ```

2. Run the setup script for development:
   ```bash
   ./docker-setup.sh dev
   ```

3. Edit the .env file with your specific settings if needed.

4. Access the application at http://localhost:8000

#### Production Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/teja499-tech/amaravathi-rmcms.git
   cd amaravathi-rmcms
   ```

2. Copy the environment example file and configure it:
   ```bash
   cp env.docker.example .env
   ```

3. Edit the .env file with your production settings:
   - Set secure DB_PASSWORD and SECRET_KEY values
   - Configure your DOMAIN
   - Add SUPABASE settings if using Supabase for file storage
   - Configure email settings

4. Run the setup script for production:
   ```bash
   ./docker-setup.sh
   ```

5. Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt:
   ```bash
   # Replace yourdomain.com with your actual domain
   docker-compose run --rm certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/certbot -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
   ```

6. Restart the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

7. Access your application via your domain.

### Option 2: Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/teja499-tech/amaravathi-rmcms.git
   cd amaravathi-rmcms
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a .env file using the template:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   
5. Update the .env file with your settings.

6. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. Create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

8. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular design approach with clear separation of concerns:

- **User Interface Layer**: Role-specific UIs (Admin, Accountant, Viewer)
- **Application Layer**: Django Views, Business Logic, API Endpoints
- **Data Access Layer**: Django ORM, Model Managers, Data Services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database, File Storage, Cache System

For more details on the system architecture, see the [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture.md).

## API Integration

The system provides a RESTful API for integration with other applications. The API includes endpoints for:

- Customer management
- Delivery tracking
- Supplier management
- Financial transactions
- Reporting

For complete API documentation, refer to the [API Documentation](docs/api_docs.md).

## Health Check

The application provides a health check endpoint at `/health/` which returns a JSON response with:
- Overall status
- Database connection status
- Application version
